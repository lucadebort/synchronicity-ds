## The Art of Contemplative Design

Synchronicity is a design system crafted for applications that honor the user's attention. Born from the development of an I Ching divination app, it embodies principles of mindfulness, clarity, and purposeful restraint.

Every token, every animation, every interaction has been considered—not just for function, but for feeling.

## Core Principles

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Intentional Simplicity" icon="pencil">
    Every element earns its place. We remove visual noise so content can breathe and users can focus on what matters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm Luminosity" icon="sun">
    Gold serves as the sacred accent—drawing attention with warmth rather than aggression, creating moments of visual significance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rhythmic Motion" icon="star">
    Animations follow natural breathing patterns. Transitions feel organic, never mechanical. The interface moves with intention.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inclusive by Design" icon="approve-check">
    WCAG AA compliance is the baseline, not the goal. Every color combination is tested. Every interaction is accessible.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Architecture

The token system follows a three-tier hierarchy, separating raw values from their meaning and usage:

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Primitives** | Raw, theme-agnostic values | `gold-60`, `void-90`, `space-4` |
| **Semantic** | Purpose-driven, theme-aware | `text-primary`, `background`, `spacing-md` |
| **Component** | Specific to UI elements | `button.primary.background` |

This architecture enables scalable theming, consistent design decisions, and maintainable code.

## Three Themes

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Light" icon="sun">
    Warm cream backgrounds with grounded gold accents. Paper-like warmth for focused reading. Perfect for bright environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dark" icon="moon">
    Deep void backgrounds with luminous gold. OLED-optimized for battery efficiency and visual depth. The default experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="True Black" icon="star">
    Pure black for maximum contrast and OLED savings. Dramatic, focused, uncompromising. For those who prefer the void.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Token Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Color** | Gold spectrum, warm & cool grays, ethereal accents, semantic states |
| **Typography** | System fonts with contemplative rhythm—display, heading, body, caption |
| **Spacing** | 4px base scale with semantic mapping—xs through 3xl |
| **Motion** | Duration and easing including breathing animation timings (3.6s in, 1.2s hold, 4.8s out) |
| **Radius** | Gentle curves that soften without losing clarity—sm, md, lg, xl |
| **Shadow** | Gold-tinted shadows for warmth, optimized for mobile performance |
| **Haptics** | Tactile feedback patterns—selection, impact, notification |
