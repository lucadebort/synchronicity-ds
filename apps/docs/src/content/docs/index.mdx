## The Art of Contemplative Design

Synchronicity is a design system crafted for applications that honor the user's attention. Born from the development of an I Ching divination app, it embodies principles of mindfulness, clarity, and purposeful restraint.

Every token, every animation, every interaction has been considered—not just for function, but for feeling.

</div>

## Core Principles

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Intentional Simplicity" icon="pencil">
    Every element earns its place. We remove visual noise so content can breathe and users can focus on what matters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm Luminosity" icon="sun">
    Gold serves as the sacred accent—drawing attention with warmth rather than aggression, creating moments of visual significance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rhythmic Motion" icon="star">
    Animations follow natural breathing patterns. Transitions feel organic, never mechanical. The interface moves with intention.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inclusive by Design" icon="approve-check">
    WCAG AA compliance is the baseline, not the goal. Every color combination is tested. Every interaction is accessible.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

Get up and running in seconds:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @synchronicity/react-native @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @synchronicity/react-native @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @synchronicity/react-native @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then wrap your app with the theme provider:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@synchronicity/react-native';
import { Button, HexagramVisual } from '@synchronicity/react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="dark">
      <Button variant="primary">Begin Reading</Button>
      <HexagramVisual
        lines={['yang', 'yin', 'yang', 'yang', 'yin', 'yin']}
        size="lg"
      />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## I Ching Divination Components

Built specifically for divination applications, these components handle traditional casting methods and reading displays.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Hexagram Display" icon="star">
    Render the 64 hexagrams with support for changing lines. Includes `HexagramVisual`, `HexagramLine`, and `LineStack` for flexible layouts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coin Casting" icon="random">
    Animated three-coin method with automatic line calculation. Realistic flip animations and result tracking with `CoinFlip` and `ThreeCoins`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trigram System" icon="puzzle">
    Display the eight trigrams with Chinese characters and labels. Grid view for selection, pair view for upper/lower display.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reading Cards" icon="document">
    Beautiful cards for displaying reading summaries with hexagram visualization, dates, questions, and changing line indicators.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Example coin casting flow:

```tsx
import { ThreeCoins, HexagramVisual } from '@synchronicity/react-native';

function CastingScreen() {
  const [lines, setLines] = useState<LineType[]>([]);
  const [throwing, setThrowing] = useState(false);

  const handleThrow = () => setThrowing(true);

  const handleComplete = (result: ThrowResult) => {
    setThrowing(false);
    setLines(prev => [...prev, result.lineType]);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <ThreeCoins
        throwing={throwing}
        onPress={handleThrow}
        onThrowComplete={handleComplete}
        showValue
      />
      {lines.length === 6 && (
        <HexagramVisual lines={lines} size="xl" />
      )}
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Three Contemplative Themes

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Light" icon="sun">
    Warm cream backgrounds with grounded gold accents. Paper-like warmth for focused reading. Perfect for bright environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dark" icon="moon">
    Deep void backgrounds with luminous gold. OLED-optimized for battery efficiency and visual depth. The default experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="True Black" icon="star">
    Pure black for maximum contrast and OLED savings. Dramatic, focused, uncompromising. For those who prefer the void.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

All themes maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios and include gold-tinted shadows for consistent warmth.

## Three-Tier Token Architecture

The token system follows a clear hierarchy, separating raw values from their meaning and usage:

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Primitives** | Raw, theme-agnostic values | `gold-60`, `void-90`, `space-4` |
| **Semantic** | Purpose-driven, theme-aware | `text-primary`, `background`, `spacing-md` |
| **Component** | Specific to UI elements | `button-primary-background`, `radius-modal` |

This architecture enables scalable theming, consistent design decisions, and maintainable code across your entire application.

## Token Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Color** | Gold spectrum, warm & cool grays, ethereal accents, semantic states |
| **Typography** | System fonts with contemplative rhythm—display, heading, body, label, caption |
| **Spacing** | 4px base scale with semantic mapping—xs through 3xl |
| **Motion** | Duration and easing including breathing animation timings (3.6s in, 1.2s hold, 4.8s out) |
| **Radius** | Gentle curves that soften without losing clarity—sm, md, lg, xl, full |
| **Shadow** | Gold-tinted shadows for warmth, optimized for mobile performance |
| **Haptics** | Tactile feedback patterns—selection, impact, notification |
