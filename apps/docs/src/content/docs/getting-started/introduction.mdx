# Introduction

**Synchronicity** is a contemplative design system built for applications that value mindfulness, clarity, and purposeful interaction. It provides a complete set of design tokens, components, and guidelines for building beautiful, accessible React Native applications.

## Philosophy

Design systems are not just about consistency—they're about **intention**. Synchronicity is built on these principles:

### Contemplative Design
Every element is designed to create calm, focused experiences. From the warm gold accents to the breathing animations, Synchronicity encourages mindful interaction.

### Accessibility First
WCAG AA compliance is not optional. Every color pairing is tested for contrast, every component includes proper accessibility labels, and every interaction considers users of all abilities.

### Mobile Native
Built from the ground up for React Native, not adapted from web. Touch targets, haptic feedback, and platform-specific optimizations are core to the system.

### Scalable Architecture
The 3-tier token system (Primitives → Semantic → Component) ensures your application can grow while maintaining consistency.

## What's Included

### @synchronicity/tokens
The foundation of the design system:
- **Color tokens**: Gold spectrum, warm/cool grays, ethereal accents
- **Typography tokens**: Type scale, weights, line heights
- **Spacing tokens**: 4px grid system with semantic aliases
- **Motion tokens**: Durations, easings, spring configs
- **And more**: Radius, shadows, z-index, opacity, haptics

### @synchronicity/react-native
React Native components and hooks:
- **ThemeProvider**: Theme context with light/dark/trueBlack support
- **Components**: Button, Card, Input (more coming)
- **Hooks**: useTheme, useColors, useThemeObject

<Aside type="tip">
Start with the tokens package. You can use it without the components package if you prefer to build your own components.

## Design Principles

### Gold as the Primary Accent
Gold (#d4af37) is the signature color of Synchronicity. It represents wisdom, illumination, and value. Use it sparingly for maximum impact.

### Three Themes, One System
- **Light**: Warm cream backgrounds for daytime use
- **Dark**: Deep void backgrounds, OLED-optimized
- **True Black**: Pure black for maximum battery savings

### Breathing Rhythm
Motion in Synchronicity follows a breathing rhythm:
- Breath in: 3.6 seconds
- Hold: 1.2 seconds
- Breath out: 4.8 seconds

This creates a calming, meditative quality to animations.
