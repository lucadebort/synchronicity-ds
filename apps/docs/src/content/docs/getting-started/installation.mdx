import { Tabs, TabItem, Code, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
The npm packages are not yet published. The component library is currently in active development. For now, you can explore the [documentation](/components/) and [design tokens](/tokens/architecture/).
</Aside>

Synchronicity will be distributed as npm packages. You will be able to install just the tokens, or the complete React Native package.

## Tokens Only

If you want to use the design tokens with your own components:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @synchronicity/tokens
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## React Native Package

For the complete experience with components and hooks:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @synchronicity/react-native
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @synchronicity/react-native
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @synchronicity/react-native
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Peer Dependencies

The React Native package requires:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": ">=18.0.0",
    "react-native": ">=0.72.0",
    "react-native-reanimated": ">=3.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Local Development (Monorepo)

If you're developing locally or in a monorepo, you can reference the packages directly:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@synchronicity/tokens": "file:../synchronicity-design-system/packages/tokens",
    "@synchronicity/react-native": "file:../synchronicity-design-system/packages/react-native"
  }
}
```

Or with pnpm workspaces:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@synchronicity/tokens": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## TypeScript Support

Both packages include full TypeScript definitions. No additional @types packages needed.

```typescript
import { createTheme, type Theme, type ThemeObject } from '@synchronicity/tokens';

const theme: ThemeObject = createTheme('dark');
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Synchronicity installed, check out the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/) guide to set up theming.
