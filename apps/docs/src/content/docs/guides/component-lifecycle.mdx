title: Component Lifecycle
description: Understanding component maturity stages and versioning
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

All components in the Synchronicity Design System follow a clear lifecycle from initial development to stable release. This ensures predictability when integrating components and sets clear expectations for API stability.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

### 🟢 Stable

**Production ready with guaranteed API stability.**

- Fully tested across iOS and Android
- Complete documentation with examples
- Accessibility audit passed (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- API frozen, only receives bug fixes
- Follows semantic versioning for updates
- Safe for production use

**Breaking changes** require a major version bump and deprecation period.

---

### 🟡 Beta

**Feature complete, undergoing user testing.**

- API is stable but may receive minor adjustments
- Documentation complete
- Most testing complete, edge cases being validated
- Accessibility tested
- Safe for non-critical features
- Feedback actively incorporated

**Use when**: You want early access to new components and can tolerate minor API changes.

---

### 🔵 Alpha

**Feature complete, API may change significantly.**

- Core functionality implemented
- Basic documentation available
- API subject to breaking changes without warning
- Testing in progress
- Use with caution
- Expect bugs and rough edges

**Use when**: You're actively collaborating on development or need bleeding-edge features.

---

### ⚪ Draft

**In active development, highly unstable.**

- Experimental implementation
- API unstable and changing rapidly
- Limited or no documentation
- Not recommended for any production use
- May be removed without notice
- Proof of concept stage

**Use when**: You're contributing to development or exploring future direction.

---

### 🔴 Deprecated

**Scheduled for removal, use alternative instead.**

- No longer maintained
- Will be removed in next major version
- Migration guide provided
- Security fixes only
- Alternative component recommended
- 6-month deprecation period minimum

**Action required**: Migrate to suggested alternative before next major version.

<Aside type="caution">
Deprecated components will show console warnings in development mode. Plan migration promptly.
</Aside>

## Versioning Strategy

Synchronicity follows **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**:

### Major Version (X.0.0)

- Breaking API changes
- Component removals
- Token restructuring
- New required dependencies

**Example**: `variant` prop renamed to `type`

### Minor Version (0.X.0)

- New components
- New features (backward compatible)
- New props with defaults
- Performance improvements

**Example**: Adding `pill` prop to Button with default `false`

### Patch Version (0.0.X)

- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Internal refactoring
- Accessibility improvements (non-breaking)

**Example**: Fixing focus indicator color in dark theme

## Component Maturity Checklist

Before a component reaches **stable** status, it must pass:

### Code Quality
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] All variants implemented
- [ ] All size options functional
- [ ] Error states handled
- [ ] Loading states (if applicable)
- [ ] Design tokens used exclusively (no hardcoded values)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all props
- [ ] Interaction tests (press, focus, blur)
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Theme switching verified
- [ ] iOS tested (simulator + device)
- [ ] Android tested (emulator + device)

### Accessibility
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44×44pt
- [ ] Color contrast verified (all themes)
- [ ] Screen reader tested (VoiceOver + TalkBack)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (where applicable)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible (2px)
- [ ] Proper ARIA roles and labels

### Documentation
- [ ] Overview and purpose clear
- [ ] All variants documented with examples
- [ ] Props table complete
- [ ] Usage guidelines (Do/Don't)
- [ ] Accessibility section
- [ ] 3+ code examples
- [ ] Token reference
- [ ] Complete example

### Review
- [ ] Design review approved
- [ ] API review approved
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Cross-platform tested
- [ ] No console warnings

## Component Status Tracking

Components follow a clear maturity progression:

- **🟢 Stable**: Production ready with guaranteed API stability
- **🟡 Beta**: Feature complete, undergoing user testing
- **🔵 Alpha**: Feature complete but API may change
- **⚪ Draft**: In active development, unstable
- **🔴 Deprecated**: Scheduled for removal

Use this information to:
- Assess production readiness
- Plan upgrade paths
- Understand API stability guarantees
- Identify components needing alternatives

---

## Migration Guides

When components are deprecated, migration guides are provided:

### Example: Button `kind` → `variant`

**Deprecated in**: 2.0.0
**Removed in**: 3.0.0
**Alternative**: Use `variant` prop instead

```tsx
// ❌ Old (deprecated)
<Button kind="primary">Submit</Button>

// ✅ New (stable)
<Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>
```

**Automated migration**:
```bash
npx @synchronicity/codemod button-kind-to-variant
```

Want to help advance components through lifecycle stages?

1. **Testing**: Use components in real projects, report issues
2. **Feedback**: Share API improvement ideas
3. **Documentation**: Submit examples and use cases
4. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers, report issues
5. **Code**: Submit PRs for bug fixes or features

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use beta components in production?

**Yes**, if you accept the risk of minor API changes. Beta components are feature-complete and tested, but may receive small API adjustments based on user feedback.

### How long is the deprecation period?

**Minimum 6 months** and one major version. Security fixes are provided during this period.

### What happens to alpha components?

They may **graduate to beta** after testing, **remain in alpha** for extended development, or be **removed** if they don't meet quality standards.

### How do I track component status changes?

- Subscribe to [release notes](https://github.com/lucadebort/synchronicity-ds/releases)
- Watch the [changelog](https://github.com/lucadebort/synchronicity-ds/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- Enable update notifications in your package manager

### Can stable components change?

Only through **patch/minor versions** for bug fixes and backward-compatible improvements. Breaking changes require a new major version and deprecation period.
