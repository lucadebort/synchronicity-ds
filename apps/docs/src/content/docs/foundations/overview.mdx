# Foundations

Synchronicity is built on a philosophy of **contemplative design**—creating digital experiences that encourage mindfulness, clarity, and purposeful interaction.

## Core Principles

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Intentional Simplicity" icon="pencil">
    Every element serves a purpose. We remove visual noise to let content breathe and users focus.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm Luminosity" icon="sun">
    Gold as the primary accent creates warmth and draws attention without aggression.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rhythmic Motion" icon="star">
    Animations follow breathing patterns, creating a meditative quality to interactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inclusive Access" icon="approve-check">
    WCAG AA compliance ensures everyone can experience the design as intended.

## The Three Themes

Synchronicity supports three distinct themes, each crafted for specific contexts:

### Light Mode
Designed for daytime use and well-lit environments. Features warm cream backgrounds (`#faf8f3`) that reduce eye strain while maintaining excellent readability.

### Dark Mode
Optimized for low-light environments and OLED displays. Uses deep void backgrounds (`#0a0a0f`) that make gold accents luminous and reduce battery consumption.

### True Black Mode
Maximum contrast with pure black backgrounds (`#000000`). Ideal for OLED displays seeking maximum battery savings and users who prefer stark contrast.

## Design Language

### Gold as Sacred Accent

Gold (#d4af37) is used sparingly throughout the system. It represents:
- **Primary actions** - The most important interactive elements
- **Achievement** - Success states and completions
- **Value** - Content worth highlighting
- **Wisdom** - Knowledge and insight

### Breathing Rhythm

Motion in Synchronicity follows a breathing pattern:

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Inhale | 3.6s | Building anticipation, gathering energy |
| Hold | 1.2s | Moment of stillness, completion |
| Exhale | 4.8s | Release, resolution, calm |

This 9.6-second cycle can be used for loading states, transitions, and meditative UI elements.

### Color Temperature

Colors shift temperature based on theme:
- **Light mode**: Warm grays (beige undertones) for a cozy, paper-like feel
- **Dark mode**: Cool grays (blue undertones) for a deep, void-like quality

## Architecture

The design system follows a **3-tier token architecture**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Component Tokens              │  ← Specific component values
│         (button, card, input)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Semantic Tokens               │  ← Theme-aware, purpose-driven
│    (text-primary, background, accent)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Primitive Tokens               │  ← Raw values, theme-agnostic
│      (gold-60, space-4, void-90)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This architecture enables:
- **Scalability**: Add new themes without touching components
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for values
- **Flexibility**: Override at any level as needed
