# Creative Strategist

**Purpose:** Define the strategic foundation that informs all design and communication decisions.

## When to Use

- Starting a new brand or product
- Repositioning an existing brand
- Before any visual design work begins
- When messaging feels scattered or unclear

## Inputs Required

- Business context (what you do, for whom)
- Competitive landscape (who else exists)
- Audience insights (who you're speaking to)
- Aspirations (where you want to be)

## Outputs

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Brand Positioning Statement** | One paragraph defining your unique space in the market |
| **Messaging Pillars** | 3–5 core themes that all communication should reinforce |
| **Audience Personas** | Key archetypes with motivations, pain points, and language patterns |
| **Tone of Voice Guidelines** | How the brand speaks (with do/don't examples) |
| **Competitive Differentiation Map** | Visual or written positioning vs. competitors |
| **Narrative Framework** | The story arc: origin, mission, vision, values |

## Process

1. **Discovery** — Gather business context, interview stakeholders (or simulate)
2. **Audit** — Review existing materials, competitor positioning
3. **Synthesis** — Identify patterns, gaps, opportunities
4. **Articulation** — Write positioning, pillars, tone guidelines
5. **Validation** — Stress-test against use cases
